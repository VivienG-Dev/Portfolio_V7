# Portfolio_V7
The seventh version of my portfolio

This version is made with HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), a bit of JavaScript and the static site generators HUGO.


## The right choice!
The older version of my website was working with WordPress and Elementor. But it was honestly too slow 
and too heavy for the purpose of a simple Portfolio. So I decided to go static this time, the right tool 
for the job.

## Why HUGO ?
I started to write my website in HTML5, CSS3 and then added a bit of JavaScript wish is actually absolutely 
enough for the job, but I wanted to learn how static site generators working and I decided to convert my website
to HUGO.

HUGO has been chosen for his speed and his capacity to grow easly. And I could easy add a "blog posts" with
HUGO in the future.

## There is nothing in "themes"?!
Yes, there is nothing in the themes folder because I didn't planned to share my "theme" in the Hugo Themes website.
And if you are wondering, you aren't obligated to use the themes folder to start a website with HUGO.

## Start server ?
You can start the dev server by running `hugo server`
To build the site, run `hugo`
